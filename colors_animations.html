          The assignment was to apply a both a light theme and dark theme color
          pallet to a mockup landing page design, then add animations. The
          overall solution is a combination of the previous assignment and the
          use of animations. The assignment taught me more when it comes to
          creating color palettes and the use of fonts. For both themes, I
          decided to use darker colors.

            <strong>COMBINATION OF FONTS, COLORS AND ANIMATIONS</strong> <br />
            To complete this part I used type-scale.com. This helped me test the
            hierarchy beforehand. I used 'Forum' as my display font and 'Lato'
            as my paragraph font. The display font is only used as a h1 heading.
            For smaller headings I used Lato and adjusted the font weight to
            match the layout.

            <strong>THE FINALE PRODUCT</strong> <br />
            Working with this part required following the guidelines for
            designing UI cards and using CSS techniques that we have learned in
            class. For instance, I used contrast and proximity to draw the
            user's eye to the most important thing first. I also worked with
            styling the two buttons differently to make the user aware of the
            contrasting CTAâ€™s.
